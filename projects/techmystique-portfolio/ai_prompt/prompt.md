“Create a modern, full‑stack developer portfolio website scaffold that blends the sleek minimalism of the Windows Command Prompt with the polished developer experience of Visual Studio Code. The UI should feature a dark theme with subtle accent highlights, a fixed vertical sidebar styled like VS Code’s Explorer panel (complete with collapsible folders for ‘About’, ‘Projects’, ‘Skills’, and ‘Contact’), and a main content area that looks and feels like an interactive terminal window where sections are revealed via typed commands (for example, typing `show projects` opens a grid of project cards, each displaying live links, descriptions, and tech stack badges). Use a monospace typeface throughout, implement syntax‑highlighted code snippets in the ‘Projects’ section, and include smooth animations that mimic terminal cursor blinking and window resizing. Structure the codebase with a React or Next.js front end, a Node.js/Express (or NestJS) API back end, and a MongoDB (or PostgreSQL) database. Ensure responsive design for mobile and desktop, integrate a contact form that submits via AJAX, and optimize for fast load times. Finally, configure automated deployment scripts (e.g., GitHub Actions) to push updates to a hosting platform like Vercel or Netlify.”
